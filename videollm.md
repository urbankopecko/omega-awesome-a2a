## Video Understanding Models

### VideoLLM: Efficient Video Understanding
[ðŸ“„ Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13292) | [ðŸ’» Code](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/VideoLLM)

A breakthrough in efficient video understanding that leverages pre-trained vision-language models without requiring expensive video-specific pre-training. Its innovative temporal modeling approach achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining remarkable memory efficiency (processing 32 frames with just 16GB GPU memory).

#### Implementation Example:
```python
import torch
from videollm import VideoLLM
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as T

class VideoProcessor:
    def __init__(self, model_name="DAMO-NLP-SG/videollm-7b"):
        self.model = VideoLLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.transform = T.Compose([
            T.Resize(224),
            T.CenterCrop(224),
            T.ToTensor()
        ])
    
    def process_video_frames(self, frame_paths, question):
        # Load and preprocess frames
        frames = []
        for path in frame_paths:
            image = Image.open(path)
            frame = self.transform(image)
            frames.append(frame)
        
        # Stack frames and generate response
        video_tensor = torch.stack(frames)
        with torch.no_grad():
            response = self.model.generate(
                video_tensor,
                question,
                max_length=50
            )
        
        return response

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    processor = VideoProcessor()
    frame_paths = [f"frames/frame_{i}.jpg" for i in range(32)]
    question = "What is the main action in this video?"
    response = processor.process_video_frames(frame_paths, question)
    print(f"Model Response: {response}")
