## FishFinder: Mobile-based Multimodal ADHD Screening

### Overview
FishFinder demonstrates practical implementation of multimodal AI in healthcare diagnostics by combining mobile gameplay analytics with motion sensor data. The system processes dual data streams through an SVM classifier to achieve clinical-grade ADHD screening accuracy.

### Technical Implementation
- **Input Processing**:
  - Game interaction metrics (attention/impulsivity measures)
  - Motion sensor streams (accelerometer/gyroscope data)
- **Model Architecture**: Support Vector Machine classifier
- **Performance**:
  - Accuracy: 92.3%
  - Sensitivity: 90%
  - Specificity: 93.7%

### Why It Matters
This implementation shows how multimodal AI can make healthcare diagnostics more accessible while maintaining clinical standards. By combining multiple data streams in a game format, it creates a scalable screening tool that's both accurate and user-friendly for children.
